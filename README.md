# Calculator by Andy
This is the final JS project from The Odin Project.
The technologies used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Use either your keyboard or your mouse to interact with the calculator.
To-do: 
--- the minus sign '-' is added at the end of the string at the moment, making it look a bit funny. Need to work on it---
